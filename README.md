Homebrew PCB Shaker For Etching Using Old DVD Rom

This is a PCB shaker, and this is the project for today's video. We all know the pain when it comes to the etching process. It sometimes takes us half an hour to do the shaking process. Say no more to those dull and boring moments because we are going to make a homebrew PCB shaker, a low-cost solution that you can make yourself using readily available materials!![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36310761/230570462-4b2dc4a6-4ce0-4e7e-aea1-946839f62c55.png)
